The main purpose of this application is to create a window with a text label saying \"Hello World!\" and an exit button labeled \"Exit\". When the user clicks the \"Exit\" button, the application should gracefully close without causing any errors or abrupt termination.\n\n#### Components:\n\n1. **Tkinter Window**: \n   - This will be our main component providing the basic GUI framework.\n   \n2. **Label (Text Label with 'Hello World!')**:\n   - Displays a text message \"Hello World!\" on the window for user to see and acknowledge.\n\n3. **Button (Exit Button)**:  \n   - Provides an interactive feature where clicking this button will close the application, ensuring it closes gracefully.\n\n4. **Event Handlers**:\n   - A function linked to the button that handles the action of closing the application.\n   \n#### Detailed Blueprint:\n\n1. **Tkinter Setup**:\n   - Import `tkinter` module and create a new Tk instance to act as the main window.\n  \n2. **Label Creation**:\n   - Create a label widget with the text \"Hello World!\" using `Label()` function from `tkinter`.\n   - Set appropriate properties such as font, color, etc., for styling.\n\n3. **Button Creation**:\n   - Create a button widget that says \"Exit\" using `Button()` function.\n   - Define an event handler (function) to be associated with the click event of this button.\n\n4. **Layout Management**:\n   - Pack or place these widgets in a layout where the label appears above the exit button, ensuring they are arranged as desired.\n\n5. **Event Handler Functionality**:\n   - Implement a function that handles closing the application when the \"Exit\" button is clicked.\n   - Use `destroy()` method to close the main window when called.\n\n6. **Application Initialization and Execution**:\n   - Define methods or functions to set up all components (label, button) and then configure their behavior through event handlers.\n   - Start the Tkinter application by calling `mainloop()`, which enters a main loop of event processing for this application.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef on_exit():\n    root.destroy()\n\n# Main Application Window Creation\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Hello World Popup\")\n\n# Label Creation and Configuration\nlabel = tk.Label(root, text=\"Hello World!\", font=(\"Arial\", 18))\nlabel.pack(pady=20)\n\n# Button Creation and Configuration with event handler\nbutton = tk.Button(root, text=\"Exit\", command=on_exit)\nbutton.pack(side=tk.LEFT, padx=10)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nThis blueprint outlines the essential components needed to create a simple application fulfilling the stated requirements.

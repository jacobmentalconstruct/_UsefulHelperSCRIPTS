It contains the script that sets up and configures the environment, defines routes and controllers, and includes any necessary modules or libraries required by the application. The purpose of 'app.py' is to orchestrate the flow of requests to your web services and ensure they are processed correctly according to the defined API specifications.\n\nHere’s a basic structure of what 'app.py' might look like:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary modules\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `Flask` is imported to create the web application.\n- A route `/` is defined that responds with a simple \"Hello, World!\" message when accessed.\n- The `app.run(debug=True)` line starts the Flask development server, which allows for live reloading and debugging during development.\n\nThis structure helps in setting up a basic Flask application, making it ready to handle incoming HTTP requests and respond accordingly.","metadata":{"session_id":"21098622-da75-45b1-9ad1-a91f36631f7a","session_name":"Session"}}

# UiMAPPER requirements
# This project is intentionally stdlib-only for runtime.
# (Tkinter ships with the standard Python installer on Windows/macOS and many Linux distros.)
# If you're on Linux and Tkinter is missing, install your distro package (e.g. python3-tk).

# No pip dependencies required.
